# Students' Performance Analysis                                                          

## Dataset

> This data set consists of the marks secured by the students in various subjects. We aim to explore the influence of the parents background, test preparation, etc, on students performance.


## Summary of Findings

- Students whose parents had a master’s degree had the best performance across all the courses while those with parents with high school degrees had the worst performances. Students whose parents possessed bachelor’s degrees performed persistently well in all the courses.
