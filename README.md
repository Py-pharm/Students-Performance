# Students' Performance Analysis                                                          

## Dataset

> This data set consists of the marks secured by the students in various subjects. We aim to explore the influence of the parents background, test preparation, etc, on students performance.


## Summary of Findings

> Students whose parents had a master’s degree had the best performance across all the courses while those with parents with high school degrees had the worst performances. Students whose parents possessed bachelor’s degrees performed persistently well in all the courses.

> Students who completed the test preparation course performed better than those who did not.

> Students who ate standard lunch performed better across all courses than those who received free or reduced lunch.

> Students from race/ethnic ‘group E’ had the best performance across all the courses followed by those from ‘group D’, while students from ‘group A’ had the worst performance.
